HPLC related Figures
These are a series of figures relating to analytes that were measured via HPLC and showing the variability of the retention time or the area or concentration detected. These experiments were performed to ensure that the analysis subsequently performed was meeting IANZ (International Accreditation NZ) requirements for reproducibility and repeatability. This meant that the predictions for shelf life could be accurately measured and used for making reasonable predictions for their respective shelf lives.

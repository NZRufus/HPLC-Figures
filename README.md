## HPLC related Figures  ##
These are HPLC figures for glycated Proteins for determining reliability of the HPLC analysis in terms of Retention Time as well as peak areas in terms of reproducibility. Samples were analysed 10 times on 3 separate days to determine intra and inter day variabilities.

## Aims and Objectives ##

These are a series of figures relating to analytes that were measured via HPLC and showing the variability of the retention time or the area or concentration detected. These experiments were performed to ensure that the analysis subsequently performed was meeting IANZ (International Accreditation NZ) requirements for reproducibility and repeatability. 

## Outcomes ##

The assay was deemed to be reliable with a good consistency in both retention time as well as levels detected as deemed by the Coefficient of Variances being very low.
This meant that the predictions for shelf life could be accurately measured and used for making reasonable predictions for their respective shelf lives.
